In this project, created code  of classifying news articles for a content search engine. 
The goal is to build a model that can automatically categorize news articles into different topics or classes, enabling the search engine to deliver relevant content to users efficiently. 
To achieve this, I used the powerful torchtext library, which simplifies the process of creating a dataset for text classification analysis.
